# Next.js Application

This is a modern Next.js application built with TypeScript and React, utilizing the App Router architecture.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (Latest LTS version recommended)
- pnpm (Latest version)

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Run the development server:

## Development Guidelines

- TypeScript for type safety
- App Router architecture
- React function components (no React.FC)
- Types instead of interfaces
- React imports using `import * as React from 'react'`

## Scripts

- `pnpm build` - Build for production
- `pnpm start` - Start production server
- `pnpm lint` - Run linting
